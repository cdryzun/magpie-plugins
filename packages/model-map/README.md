# @magpie-community/middleware-model-map

New API's **模型重定向** (a channel's `model_mapping`) as [magpie](https://usemagpie.ai) gateway middleware. The model an agent asks for is sent upstream as another model. Replies then name the model the agent asked for, so an agent that reads its model's name back (Claude Code does, to size its context window) sees the name it asked for.

Install it from magpie's **Plugins › Discover**, or with `magpie plugin add @magpie-community/middleware-model-map`. Set its options under **Plugins › Installed › Options**, or with `magpie plugin options model-map '<json>'`.

## Options

```json
{ "mapping": {
    "fast": "deepseek-chat",
    "/^claude-(.*)$/": "glm-$1"
} }
```

- **Mapping.** A name maps to its target. Names chain (`a → b → c`) until there is nothing more to map, and a cycle stops before it repeats.
- **Patterns.** A key written `/like this/` is a regular expression, and its target can use `$1` for the first group.
- **Flat form.** New API's flat form, `{"fast": "deepseek-chat"}`, works as well.
- **`keep_upstream_name`.** Set it to `true` to leave the upstream model's name in replies.

The target has to be a model magpie can route: a model of one of your providers, or one of magpie's own ids (`deepseek/deepseek-chat`, for example).

**Gemini.** A Gemini request names its model in the URL; magpie moves it into the body before the middleware runs, so it is mapped like any other API, and the reply's `modelVersion` names the model asked for again.

中文：New API 的「模型重定向」，作为 magpie 网关中间件。回复里的模型名会还原成 agent 请求时用的名字。
